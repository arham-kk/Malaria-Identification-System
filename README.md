# Malaria Identification System Using Deep Learning
Malaria, a deadly mosquito-borne blood disease, claims hundreds of thousands of lives each year. In 2020 alone, there were a staggering 241 million malaria infections and 627,000 fatalities worldwide. The current method of diagnosing malaria involves laborious manual examination of blood smears under a microscope by highly trained technicians. It's not only inefficient but also relies heavily on human expertise, leaving room for errors and misdiagnoses.
But what if we could change that?

## Our Vision
Welcome to our final year project, the "Malaria Identification System Using Deep Learning." We are on a mission to revolutionize malaria diagnosis and save lives through technology. Our vision is simple: make malaria detection quick, accessible, and highly accurate. 
## The Solution

We are building a cutting-edge web-based application that harnesses the power of image processing and deep learning algorithms to detect infected cells from images of thin blood smears on standard microscope slides. By automating the diagnosis process, we not only reduce the workload on laboratories and doctors but also eliminate errors caused by faulty equipment and human judgment.
